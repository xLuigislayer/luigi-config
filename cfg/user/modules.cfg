//These settings are tuned to provide maximum performance
//while still providing maximum visual clarity

lod=medium				//lowest setting that enables facial animations
lighting=medium			//performance hit but allows you to see brighter silhouettes in dark places. specular is disabled in preferences.cfg
lighting_ex=high 		//apparently setting this to low could actually reduce performance o_O
shadows=ultra 			//max shadows is literally wallhacks in this garbage engine so use them lmao
effects=low 			//removes many, many distracting effects
textures=very_low
water=medium 			//minimum setting that allows you to see (potentially enemies) through water
particles=very_low 		//i couldnt find a single particle effect that justified turning this setting higher
post_processing=off		//the game literally looks better without post processing why would you even
motion_blur=off			//it's off by default but Just To Be Safe
aa=off					//cringe
aa_msaa=off				//cringe
texture_filter=bilinear	//i wanted to make a case for 16x but with textures this low there is no notable difference
characters=medium		//enables facial animations, this is sometimes helpful since injured opponents will make a :( face
decals=medium			//drawing 32 decals seemed reasonable enough to see where bullet holes are going
decals_models=low		//minimal performance hit and lets you see bullet holes on some props. so maybe helpful. maybe. not too sure
decals_art=on			//some maps have important decals like directional arrows, so having this on is generally good especially on dev texture maps
gibs=off
props=low				//props like bottles will be removed from the game but i dont think anything notable
ragdolls=off			//i'd love to find a justification for ragdolls but overall nah
3dsky=off
jigglebones=off
sheens_speed=slow
sheens_tint=full		//make it very very known that you have a killstreak weapon, no performance hit i think

ropes=off
killstreaks=off 		//who cares lol
outlines=high 			//tactical advantage
sound=ultra 			//minimal performance hit and it might help who knows lol
